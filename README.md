# popgen_code
Code for comparative population genetic analyses (IMBE)

Currently the code will take a fasta file of aligned sequences and go through the steps to make a DAPC, both based on finding the clusters in the data and based on the sampling locations. Will create scatter.dapc plots. Relies on adegenet package in R.
